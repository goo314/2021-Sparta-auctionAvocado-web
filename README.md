# Avocado

**Avocado ü•ë** is a personal project developed over 5 weeks as part of a beginner web development course. It is an **online auction platform** supporting both **lowest-bid** and **highest-bid** formats ‚Äî with no restrictions on the type of goods or services being traded.


## Overview

Avocado allows users to:
- Post a request and receive **lowest price offers** (e.g. ‚ÄúCan someone help me move?‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it for $10!‚Äù)
- List an item or skill and receive **highest bids** (e.g. ‚ÄúSelling a painting‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay $50!‚Äù)

The platform is inspired by:
- A friend‚Äôs idea: "Even non-famous artists should have a place to auction their work"
- A comedy show auction segment and quirky posts found on second-hand platforms

## Tech Stack & Features

### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS with Bootstrap** for responsive UI
- **JavaScript / jQuery** for dynamic behavior (carousel, posting interface, modal toggle)

### Backend
- **Flask (Python)**: All APIs built in `app.py`
- **Functionality**: User login, registration, posting content, adding comments

### Deployment
- Hosted on a remote server via **FileZilla**
- Live site (expired): [goo314.shop](http://goo314.shop)


## Challenges & Learnings

- **Design difficulties**: Overcame indecisiveness using browser inspect tools and Bootstrap components
- **Carousel bugs**: Fixed visibility issues by adjusting image sizes
- **Datetime mismatch**: Solved by converting values to string before saving
- **UI layout struggles**: Discovered and used `flex` for better positioning


## Personal Reflection

This was my **first full-stack web project**, and completing it solo was both challenging and rewarding.  
Though I often doubted my progress (‚ÄúWhat am I doing?‚Äù), documenting daily steps in a **developer journal** helped me stay on track. I'm proud of what I built and excited to keep learning!
